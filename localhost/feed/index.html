								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York’s New York City Ballet is an institution, having attracted an audience of marquee names for two generations. That audience looked positively geriatric on Jan. 4, as 88-year-old Maria Tallchief appeared in an excerpt from the company’s soprano duet “Rhythm of the Night,” following the much-older Maya Plisetskaya in an excerpt from the same ballet’s company premiere. The titles make a point. Despite the company’s marketing campaign (an image of the dancers appeared alongside a bright yellow envelope), the program was simply called “Soprano duets.”<br />
Why should old folk like these need to get out of their homes and onto a stage? Why not let seniors simply live at home and then enjoy their independence by attending matinees at Broadway’s Lyric Theatre, where tickets are reasonably priced?<br />
The dances in the company’s performance were all adapted from classical music. The music wasn’t anything new, but the movement and gestures were. In one excerpt, for example, two elderly couple occupy a separate part of the balcony while sitting on armchairs that are situated on either side of the orchestra. In another, the older person’s lower torso and arms are on the steps of a staircase that leads to the front of the stage, while his higher body and arms remain in the second balcony.<br />
It’s a simple solution, and one that really isn’t necessary. Properly taken advantage of, the ideas behind dance and composition can have an extraordinary effect on aging. Just look at Doris Day, a really physically fit sixty-four-year-old woman who was able to incorporate the intricate dance steps of her husband in the 1950s film, “Six Weeks,” into her efforts as a fencing instructor. (She died just last year, at age 93.)<br />
Now enter the preservationists. In 2003, the National Trust for Historic Preservation released a report about the preservation of “wonders” in America. In its assessment of music history, it listed three classic programs that the nation’s most famous music conservatories would shutter in the next fifty years. First on the list was the New England Conservatory of Music, followed by the Juilliard School, and finally the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. According to the Trust, these institutions’ theatres will be demolished unless the nonprofit corporations offering them cheap or free tickets address the public’s desires for “anyone of any age to experience culture, diversity, and ‘higher’ art.”<br />
Which brings us back to the elderly. Hopefully, those who look in at the box seats at Lincoln Center before the curtain goes up will be thrilled with what they see.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nearly two decades, the Navy is finally retiring the vessel in question and will name it after a hero of the U.S. military, WTVJ-Ch. 6 reported.<br />
The aircraft carrier named the USS Midway is being decommissioned and will be reborn as the USS Midway, a new generation of jet fighter.<br />
The Midway was the only ship to have destroyed a Japanese aircraft during the battle of Iwo Jima.<br />
The Midway is also the only carrier to conduct a successful in-flight rescue of Navy seal and will now become the first Navy aircraft carrier named after someone from Florida.<br />
Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., and Mayor Turner, along with other members of Congress, made the announcement on Friday and said a future board of oversight will now ask the Navy to look for funding to repair the Midway to be named for Black Pearl.<br />
“This is something that should have been done as far back as 1994,” said Wilson, WTVJ reported. “To commemorate this icon that she truly was, and move forward to name it after her, her namesake after Richard Turner of the City of Miami.<br />
Turner is a retired Navy captain who served in the Pacific during World War II and commanded a destroyer in Iwo Jima. The USS Midway will take over Turner’s repetoire.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON — President Trump’s top legal team Friday vigorously rejected a new report saying he had tried to interfere with a federal probe into his 2016 campaign, declaring the episode “total nonstory” in an unusual move for a White House trying to defend its leader.<br />
But it also confirmed that Mr. Trump had, as the report suggested, personally telephoned a senior law enforcement official during the middle of the summer 2016 campaign to attempt to persuade him to refer a review of contact between campaign advisers and Russia to another FBI director who was already investigating the matter.<br />
A new book on Mr. Trump’s early days in office by Bob Woodward and his co-author Erik Wemple identifies FBI Director James B. Comey as the man who was offered that change of leadership at the FBI as well as other concessions to end a sweeping Russia investigation.<br />
The White House did not say whether Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey for these guarantees, but Mr. Woodward and his co-author described several high-level meetings and telephone calls during the summer of 2016, shortly after Mr. Trump was elected president.<br />
The press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, pressed the point that the report of Mr. Trump’s 2016 intervention to Mr. Comey was based on the private musings of unnamed sources. But several people were present when the two men spoke. Mr. Trump’s team would not say who they were.<br />
“This is a brazen example of blatant political bias and extreme bias, and it’s the last thing we need in a time where our president is being investigated,” said Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer working with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel charged with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 campaign.<br />
Mr. Cobb, who had not spoken to Mr. Trump since being hired as Mr. Mueller’s chief spokesman on Jan. 20, 2017, said that the new report was simply “incorrect and inaccurate,” and that it was “particularly disappointing” because it had the “sheer audacity to attach the president’s name to a false report.”<br />
But Mr. Cobb also hinted that he could be providing Mr. Mueller with information about the episode that other officials had not and that could implicate him and Mr. Trump in the matter.<br />
Asked whether Mr. Cobb could provide information he did not already know about Mr. Trump’s attempts to influence Mr. Comey, Mr. Cobb said: “There are people on the outside who are providing information to us. That’s why I say it’s the last thing we need.”<br />
The president’s legal team has been divided over whether Mr. Mueller should conclude that Mr. Trump should be referred to a grand jury for impeachment, and about whether the president should turn over documents requested by Mr. Mueller.<br />
Mr. Cobb has steered clear of making the case for impeachment, in part because it is a legal argument with no clear legal footing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren recently jumped into a spotlight from which they seemed destined to emerge much different than before, but the latter is trying to cool a simmering controversy over her role in the rise of Mr. Sanders’s presidential campaign.<br />
Now the two lawmakers, a Vermont senator and a Massachusetts senator, have called a Tuesday news conference here to trumpet their agreement on the steps of the Old State Capitol as part of a broader alliance that some hope will lead to Democrats matching the White House by winning control of the Senate this fall.<br />
Their contest in Iowa is shaping up to be one of the most watched Senate races in the country and Sen. Warren, the darling of progressives nationally, hopes her candidacy can finish atop the primary for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Sanders is mounting a strong challenge.<br />
But while campaigning in Iowa Monday, Sen. Warren subtly equated her support for Mr. Sanders with what she described as her father’s belief that fighting for a cause leads to achieving change. Her father, economist William Warren Buffett, is a Warren Republican who backed two former presidents, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Workers use cranes to rescue snow-covered cars after cars slid off the road on Interstate 55 in Mount Vernon, Ill., on Friday, Jan. 19, 2020. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune via AP)<br />
From heavy snow in the Midwest to extremely cold temperatures in the East, days of bitter cold and heavy snows delivered a bleak reminder of how dicey winter can be for commuters across the country.<br />
Some roads and highways were closed Friday and several airlines canceled flights.<br />
In Louisville, Kentucky, more than a foot of snow was reported overnight, and winter storm warnings remained in effect for some parts of Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio.<br />
In Jeffersonville, Indiana, snow fell throughout the morning, with accumulations up to 6 inches. Weather warnings stretched from northern Kentucky into Indiana and south into Illinois. Illinois&#8217; tollway suspended all Interstate 57 and Interstate 94 southbound near Champaign because of significant snow accumulations and poor road conditions.<br />
In Missouri, parts of western and southern parts of the state received up to a foot of snow. Missouri Highway Patrol tweeted that snow was causing trouble for drivers in several communities. Ice also was making travel difficult in parts of Kentucky.<br />
In central Kentucky, scores of vehicles were stranded on Interstate 65 because of icy conditions. And in northwestern Indiana, a multicounty emergency operations center was activated because of severe weather.<br />
In states like Illinois, Ohio and Indiana, roads were treacherous, while in Louisville, Kentucky, more than three inches of snow piled up in an hour. At least 100 schools were closed in Kentucky, although most were expected to reopen on Friday.<br />
In Wisconsin, 12 to 15 inches of snow were reported in western parts of the state. In Missouri, eight people in the St. Louis area were rescued by search and rescue teams in four-wheel-drive vehicles after their car slid into a ditch, said Amy Seeley, a spokeswoman for Missouri State Highway Patrol.<br />
In southeastern Illinois, more than 5 inches of snow fell. State emergency officials also activated their operations center.<br />
Temperatures were expected to plummet overnight, bringing bitterly cold temperatures to the East that could break all-time records. The National Weather Service predicted that Chicago would see a low of minus-30 degrees on Friday night, while Albany, New York, could hit a low of minus-33 degrees. New York City was forecast to see a wind chill of 40 below by the end of the weekend.<br />
&#8220;It feels like the wind chill is 10 or 20 below zero,&#8221; said Maryland resident Natalie Evans, who was taking a walk on the Broad Creek Greenway on Friday in Baltimore.<br />
One victim of the extreme cold is Sioux Falls, South Dakota, store clerk Meghan Nelson, who was hospitalized in very bad pain after dropping two ice cream scoops on her head when a customer accidentally took them off the counter Wednesday. Doctors did not want to release her until she had at least three fully healed teeth.<br />
The forecast called for a high temperature of 8 on Friday in Minneapolis, but wind chills below minus-40 were expected.<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s the worst part about living out here,&#8221; said Minnesota resident Steve Wenthe. &#8220;When I get out of the car, it&#8217;s like walking on ice.&#8221;<br />
Wind gusts of 50 mph or more were expected to batter Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, with wind chills falling below zero throughout the weekend.<br />
Associated Press writers Ashraf Khalil in Cairo, Iowa, and Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death of Heather Heyer while protesting the white supremacist “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville has touched many in Virginia and across the country. And while many have pointed to a few lawmakers and the work they did on issues such as racial profiling and potential rights protections for transgender students as examples of how Virginia will respond, there has been little discussion of what Virginia will do next — and how much of what was learned from last year’s events is still relevant.<br />
In a way, the state Legislature is in a bit of a unique position to address issues that have been in the state’s consciousness for decades. Unlike a litmus test election, where party allegiance and ideological tilt are central to the campaign, Virginia’s peculiar voting system presents lawmakers with a choice. Do they continue to follow the path of Thomas Jefferson, who guided them with the doctrine of representative government, or do they follow the path laid out by Virginia’s authors, who were abolitionists, or its present Supreme Court, which was at the forefront of the push for gay marriage?<br />
Most would argue the answer is not to follow Jefferson or to follow the courts. So much of Virginia’s contemporary political culture is grounded in Jefferson and his vision of the ideal legislator, a people’s representative. The constitutional powers of the Virginia Legislature are limited to enacting laws based on those delegated to the federal government. This state repubic’s neglect of this distinction during the Civil War led to the authorization of the federal government to take a portion of Virginia’s land, a process that would define Virginia’s political relationships with Washington for the next two centuries. This bit of known knowledge informs nearly every statute, state administrative law, or judicial rule the Virginia Legislature considers.<br />
This history has not, however, prevented Virginia from slipping backward.<br />
Black voter turnout has been in decline. The state has twice engaged in the admissions practices that have been used to deny African-Americans access to college. As a result, Virginia’s African-American voter turnout has declined, among other reasons, because it is harder to register, it is harder to vote early and it is harder to vote absentee on Election Day.<br />
As a result, despite being the nation’s 13th largest state, Virginia has fewer African-American elected officials than any other state in the country.<br />
As a result, it has fewer African-American elected officials than any other state in the country.<br />
In 1982, efforts to erect a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee in Arlington Cemetery, despite the fact that the Confederate general was eventually buried there, prompted an organized effort to remove the statue. Later, attempts by Republican Gov. Robert McDonnell and state legislators to erect statues or memorials in honor of Confederate soldiers became infamous. The effort led to widespread protests, and eventually died.<br />
In 2018, state Republican leadership pushed through a measure to establish a $1 million commemoration for the Confederate soldiers who fought in the Civil War — even though it was not named specifically for a particular group of soldiers or against a specific race. It was proposed, explained, pushed through and debated in an atmosphere of overt Southern nostalgia.<br />
Instead of facing this push for new monuments, Virginia lawmakers passed a bill to prevent Arlington Park from adding Confederate war graves to Arlington Cemetery’s estimated 1,000 Confederate soldiers that are currently interred there. Virginia’s legislature, however, chose to leave the so-called Lee stone — a brick or granite wall on the perimeter of Arlington Cemetery marking the graves of Lee and the other Confederate generals who fought in the Civil War — standing.<br />
Virginia’s sluggish black voter turnout rate is part of a larger problem. Black voters have persistently had very low participation rates and, in some places, one of the lowest rates in the country.<br />
Virginia also continues to allow poll checks, a policy that allows people to get a ballot and fill it out without having to vote, all without going to a physical polling place. Voters who are not registered can sign in at a polling place, along with their driver’s license, but not vote absentee.<br />
At the moment, Virginia legislators are considering making poll checks legal. As voters, advocates for and against the law will participate in an online survey for free.<br />
What will Virginia do about these issues? In light of Heyer’s death, and on the anniversary of that 2017 rally, Virginia lawmakers and state officials will hear suggestions for legislation — and a refresher on policies dating to the last 140 years — from all sorts of players.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Story highlights<br />
It doesn&#8217;t usually get high rankings among gruesome incidents, but on Jan. 2, Navy SEALs executed three prisoners in a compound at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, with very little advance notice.<br />
The three men were detainees who claimed to be innocent civilians killed by U.S. forces. After a long-running battle, the U.S. military officially admitted last week that the men were under interrogation and tried to keep them in a cell for a year or more until they could come up with information in exchange for their freedom.<br />
The clash offers a rare glimpse into the tangled legal and ethical minefield of America&#8217;s secret war on terror, which operates outside of the rule of law and denies its victims due process. In January 2014, Feroz Abassi, a Moroccan who told his interrogators he worked as a translator for al-Qaida, was moved to Cuba from Afghanistan and subjected to interrogation for three months. According to his CIA interrogators, Abassi was protected by immunity under the 1988 Convention Against Torture, a U.N. treaty that prohibits the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. But the U.S. government kept Abassi at Guantánamo as an enemy combatant without congressional authorization and without seeking his version of events under the nation&#8217;s Army Field Manual.<br />
Abassi eventually signed a statement with the Americans claiming to be a victim of al-Qaida. But his family members insist he was not a criminal — he was a person who simply wanted to return to his native Morocco. His release became a cause célèbre, partially because of his proximity to President Obama, who held a prisoner exchange that transferred him home just before leaving office.<br />
As part of the release, the Navy SEALs responsible for Abassi&#8217;s execution had to decide whether to keep him alive. When Abassi refused food and water, they suspected he might have been under coercion, having been subject to torture. So they moved him to a cell, which they knew was small, dirty and dangerous, but where they thought they could find enough food and clean water. That night, they provided water and increased the light, hoping that he might weaken.<br />
Abassi was found in the next morning, his arm puffed out like a balloon and his mouth sewn shut.<br />
The three men found in their cell were prisoners whom the U.S. accused of helping militants while they were in Yemen. It had long been clear that prisoners held without charges at Guantánamo Bay had the chance to voluntarily receive a confession in exchange for freedom. But many detainees argue the U.S. has no right to use torture, which even the CIA admits is degrading, if not often illegal. Several legal and human rights groups have filed legal briefs arguing that the U.S. violated international law by holding prisoners in an undeclared war for which the law permits no such thing. The cases of Adnan Latif and Ali Hamza Ahmed Al Bahlul, detainees who claim to have been tortured by the U.S., have been reviewed by the courts and have been found legally warranted under evidence that officials hid from the courts, something one U.S. official told the Associated Press amounted to &#8220;a cover-up.&#8221;<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands are expected to attend the Second Amendment Rally in Richmond today, spurred on by the shooting death of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville last month. It is likely to be the largest such gathering of gun rights supporters in the nation.<br />
Here are things to know:<br />
What’s the purpose of the rally?<br />
The rally is ostensibly meant to raise awareness of a measure passed by Virginia in 2015 that legalizes gun rights to a certain extent in the state.<br />
Here’s how Virginia defines a “lawful” gun owner:<br />
A person who owns, possesses, or has access to a legally permitted firearm, firearm accessory, or ammunition in Virginia, is a lawful owner of that firearm or firearm accessory. A person is a lawful owner of that firearm or firearm accessory if he, her, or they, as on or after December 31, 2015, are legally authorized by law to possess, possess, or use that firearm or firearm accessory. Also, a person is a lawful owner of that firearm or firearm accessory if they are a member of a club or association.<br />
What’s the specific law?<br />
The measure was meant to expand the ability of gun owners to possess firearms in some instances in the state without the need for a license. Currently, Virginia has a law allowing people 21 and older to own up to three guns. An individual must apply for and obtain a firearm owner’s identification card and ammunition ownership permits to own a concealed handgun.<br />
“It’s not for everybody, but if a person is able to qualify, then it should be allowed,” John Rhee, the executive director of Virginia Citizens Defense League, a nonprofit group that describes itself as “the fourth-largest gun owner organization in the nation.”<br />
The rally, he added, is intended to educate the public on the law.<br />
Virginia has a number of other restrictions on gun ownership. Firearms owners who are under 21 years old can only purchase firearms from a licensed dealer if they are serving as a close family member or guardian of a minor under 18. Anyone who purchases a firearm in Virginia must then apply for a license at their local sheriff’s office. Those who sell firearms must also be licensed and must register with the Virginia Board of Licensed Firearms Dealers.<br />
What are the opponents of the rally saying?<br />
National Rifle Association spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said on Friday that the Virginia measure “puts an extra barrier between honest, law-abiding gun owners and their firearms.”<br />
“No doubt, the Second Amendment Rally intends to illegally legalize carry in many places in Virginia,” he said. “The NRA, unlike many organizations that support this rally, will not take any position on it. We will remain neutral on the debate.”<br />
A group called “No Armed Protesters” opposes the rally, contending that such gatherings pose a public safety risk.<br />
“Just like last weekend in Orlando, guns are going to be everywhere and both sides are going to get crazy with violence,” said Brett Horvath, one of the group’s organizers. “We don’t want that to happen in Virginia, but this law specifically criminalizes the peaceful assembly of unarmed citizens exercising their Constitutional rights.”<br />
George Parker, president of the Virginia Carry group, which is also holding a separate rally at the state Capitol in Richmond this afternoon, said he hoped the rally “will send a message to the politicians and special interest groups in Virginia who oppose Second Amendment rights in favor of their control.”<br />
“The people have spoken,” he said. “This rally is absolutely important for the future of America.”<br />
The rally begins at 10 a.m. in the Richmond area. ABC 7 News will have coverage.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A California man was convicted on Wednesday of stealing 60 puppies from a California animal sanctuary, and of the dozens of felony charges he faces for their ensuing sale on the black market, The Daily Telegraph reported.<br />
Bobby la taupe was found guilty on 45 counts of grand theft, petty theft, trespassing, forgery and resisting arrest, the British news outlet said.<br />
The 51-year-old pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in the case in exchange for prosecutors dropping most of the felony charges. Authorities say that in August 2018, the San Diego native was caught stealing more than $60,000 worth of puppies from the Grace Sanctuary in a nearby town after it was discovered he had been unlawfully taking them for nine months.<br />
Bobby La Taupe was convicted on Friday for stealing 60 puppies from a California animal sanctuary.<br />
The sanctuary’s owner Christopher Tarzone discovered that the thief had slipped an electronic device into some of the pups’ collars, allowing him to scan their chests for distinctive pitter-patter sounds. He then allegedly concealed the animals’ crates in the hangar in El Cajon, San Diego County.<br />
